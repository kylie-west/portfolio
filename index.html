						Hi! My name is Kylie. In college, I studied biology because of my
						love for animals and nature. But after graduating, I was seeking
						adventure, so I moved to South Korea to teach English through a
						program called EPIK. This experience was filled with challenges, but
						the culture, food, and my wonderful students made it all worth it!
					</p>
					<p>
						During my time in Korea, I gave a lot of thought to what I wanted to
						do for my career in the long run (since teaching overseas is almost
						always a temporary gig), and I remembered that when I was a kid, I
						always loved playing with HTML and CSS, building webpages, and
						customizing my Neopets shop with tiled background images and MIDI
						music.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, after returning to the States, I began studying web development
						in my free time. Luckily, it turned out that I still really enjoyed
						it! As I continued, I learned how to solve problems and build full
						applications using front-end technologies like JavaScript and React.
					</p>
					<p>
						While I was studying on my own, my brother graduated with a CS
						degree and ended up going through the FastTrack program, which
						helped him land his first job as a software developer. He then
						recommended that I apply, too. So I did, and it's been an amazing
						opportunity for me, as it's helped me expand my skillset to the back
						end with technologies like Java and Spring, as well as solidify my
						knowledge on the front end.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my free time, I enjoy drawing (both digitally and traditionally),
						listening to weird music, learning languages, and indoor bouldering
						(though I'm not any good at it yet).
